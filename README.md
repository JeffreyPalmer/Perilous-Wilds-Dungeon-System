# Perilous-Wilds-Dungeon-System
A markdown version of the on-the-fly dungeon creation system from the Dungeon World supplement The Perilous Wilds.

## Usage
This project is basically one document, with its raw form being in markdown format. Specifically, it uses [Pandoc Markdown](http://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#pandocs-markdown). It uses some features that GitHub's markdown renderer doesn't support (mostly to do with tables), and so GitHub's website doesn't render it very well.
